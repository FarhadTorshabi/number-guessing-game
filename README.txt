# Number Guessing Game (Python)

This project is a simple number guessing game written in Python.
It was created as part of my Python learning journey.

## 🎯 How the game works
- The user selects a number range.
- The computer randomly chooses a number in that range.
- The player has a limited number of attempts to guess the number.
- The game provides hints such as:
  - Too high / Too low
  - Hot / Very hot / Cold
- The player can play multiple rounds and track a best score.

## 🧠 What I practiced
- Python functions
- Loops and conditionals
- User input and validation
- Random number generation
- Writing clean and readable code

## ▶️ How to run the game
1. Make sure Python is installed.
2. Download or clone this repository.
3. Run the file:
   ```bash
   python guess_number.py

🤝 Note

This project was developed while learning Python, with guidance and explanations from ChatGPT.
I understand the code and continue to improve it step by step.

📌 Status

Beginner project – improving gradually.

“Next improvement: add difficulty levels (Easy / Medium / Hard)”

## Update
This project was later improved to include:
- Difficulty levels (easy, medium, hard)
- Hot/cold hints
- Best score tracking
- Improved input validation
